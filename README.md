# Free Tile Services

This repository, inspired by [BBBike Map Compare](http://mc.bbbike.org/mc/), hopes to serve as an index for free, high quality
image tile services that can be used by Leaflet, and other JavaScript mapping libraries.

### [View The Site](http://alexurquhart.github.io/free-tiles)

## Usage
The basemaps can be changed with the select box, or the next/previous buttons on the navbar. The green + icon can be used to
add a single overlay to the map.

The Info button provides the endpoints for the basemap/overlay, as well as links to launch a demo of the map in Codepen or 
JsFiddle

## Contributing
Feel free to submit a pull request with any additional high quality tile providers. For the time being I would like to exclude
tile providers that cover a limited geographic area. Datasets should be continent or world wide, and load reasonably quick.

## TODO
I would like to curate attribution information (ie "© OpenStreetMap contributors" for OSM data) for each basemap and overlay.

I would also like to place a link to the data providers website in the info modal for each basemap and overlay.
